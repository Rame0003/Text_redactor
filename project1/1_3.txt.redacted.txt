This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman . ' There is NO chemistry between ███████ and the unknown woman who plays his love interest . The dialog is wooden , the situations hackneyed . It 's too long and the climax is anti-climactic ( ! ) . I love the USCG , its men and women are fearless and tough . The action scenes are awesome , but this movie does n't do much for recruiting , I fear . The script is formulaic , but confusing . ███████ 's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that was n't his fault ? Costner 's is raging against the dying of the light , but why ? His 'conflict ' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle . I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money 's worth .
