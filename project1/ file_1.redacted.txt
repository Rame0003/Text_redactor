Once again Mr. ███████ has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters . Most of us have ghosts in the closet , and ███████ 's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time I did not care . The character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident ██████████████ . The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he 's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . His only obstacle appears to be winning over ███████ . Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , ███████ tells us all about ███████ 's ghosts . We are told why ███████ is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . No magic here , it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .
